# ☀️ RayNet – Community Solar Sharing Platform

RayNet is a web-based prototype that empowers local communities and underserved colonies to **share, reserve, and monitor solar energy** collectively—especially for cultural occasions, power outages, and energy-shortage scenarios.

> 🛠️ **Note:** This is a prototype/demo version developed for a hackathon. The platform is still in its early development phase, with simulated mock data for demonstration purposes.

## 🔍 What is RayNet?

RayNet is inspired by the idea of **"energy democracy"**—making solar power accessible, shareable, and meaningful to communities who often can’t afford private solar installations.

Think of it as a **community library**, but for clean energy.

🎯 **Use Cases:**
- Borrow solar energy for **Diwali, Eid, weddings, local functions**
- Power backup during **frequent power cuts**
- Share unused solar energy between flats/neighbors
- Track usage and promote **climate-friendly behavior**
